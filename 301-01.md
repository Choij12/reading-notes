# Components 
- Componenents-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design
- it turns into individual functional or logical components 
- represents well definded communication interfaces that contains methods, events, and properties
- provides higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub problems
- primary objective is to ensure component reuseability
- component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reuseable set of well defined functionalilty 
- software object, intended to interact with other components
- software component can be defined as a unit of composition 
- can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties
- object oriented view - viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes
- conventional view - viewed as a finctional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic
- process related view - instead of creating each component from scratch, system builds from existing components in a library
- characterisitics of components - reusabilty, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
- principles of component based design - represented by using some intermediary representation
- component level design - creates a naming conventions for components that are specificied as part of the architectural model
- conducting component level design - recognizes all design classes that correspond to the problem domain 
- advantages of using component based architecture - ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reuseable, modification of techinical complexity, reliability, system maintenance, evolution, and independency

## Props and how to use it in React
- props is a special keyword in react - stands for properties and used for passing data from one component to another
- react is a component based library that divides the UI 
- data with props are being passed in a "uni-directional flow" 
- props data - read only
- props in react - define an attribute and its value - passes it to child componenet by using props - then renders the props data
- props stand for propererties 
- its passed to components like function arguments
- only be passed to components in one way
- parent - to - child
