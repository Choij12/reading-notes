# Django CRUD and Forms
- Forms are meant for collecting user input because there are so many suitable widgets out there for entering all types of data to include:
    * text boxes
    * checkboxes
    * radio buttons
    * date pickers
    * etc.
 * Forms are a secure way to share data with a server: They allow us to send data via POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection
 * Django's form handling techniques are very similar to when we display information from a model
  * The view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns as an HTML page from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed
  * The server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and then redisplay the page if there are any errors
- The image above demonstrates Django's handling process for forms:
- Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user
- Recieve data from a submit request and bind it to the form
- Clean and validate the data
- If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields
- If all data is valid, perform required actions:
    * save data
    * send an email
    * return the result of a search
    * upload a file
    * etc.
 - Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page
