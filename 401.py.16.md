# Serverless Functions

## What is Serverless Computing?
- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event.
- This article defines serverless, which does not exclude the need of servers.
- Instead, it means that server resources are proportional to demand, and that requests are serviced quickly and in real time. 
- Server resources can start processes from zero in a fraction of a second. It transfers server maintenance responsibilities from the app's developers to the serverless provider. 
- It's also good for parallel processes because resources are paid by time rather than processing density, which is wonderful for compute applications but not so great for things that require low latency because it still takes a few seconds to start up. 
- Serverless isn't good for things that have a predictable, steady load because it tends to be more expensive.
- Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework - Java, Python, node.js
- For certain workloads, such as ones that require parallel processing, serverless can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.
- Serverless architectures forgo long-running processes in favor of scaling up and down to zero, they also sometimes need to start up from zero to serve a new request. For certain applications, this startup latency isnâ€™t noticeable or detrimental to users.
