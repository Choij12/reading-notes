# Python Scope

## Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code
### Global
- The notions of global scope and global names are tightly associated with module files. For example, if you define a name at the top level of any Python module, then that name is considered global to the module.
- A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.
- Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.
- If you call `dir()` with no arguments, then you get a list containing the names that live in the global scope. You can also use dir() to inspect the list of names or attributes of different objects. 
- For a global name inside a function, one must create a new local name in the function scope.
- In order to modify this behavior, one can use a global statement.
- The global statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas.
### The nonlocal Statement
- Nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated.
- Similar as global scope, if you want to modify them, then you need to use a nonlocal statement.
- Nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas.
- The statement nonlocal `var`, you tell Python that you’ll be modifying var inside `nested()`.
- Unlike global, you can’t use nonlocal outside of a nested or enclosed function.

## Don’t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!
- The following video provides another perspective on big O notation, The primary focus of the video was mainly on the time and not space complexity.
The gentleman discusses the gerneral terms of the big 0 notation as well as elaborate more on what it is, how it is used and what it is important.
He provided examples of different data structure and algorithm methods and went over the complexities and mentions the time complexity, logarithmic time complexity, log-linear time complexity.
