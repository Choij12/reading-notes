# Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?
- For security purposes, we don't want users to access to data that do not have access.
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
- Anything that has their personal info or banking info. Such as paypal
3. What is a role used for?
- To assign capabilies to a user to access data
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- Role based access control allows the admin to assign access and user roles based on the individual's role in the organization, rather than setting access specifications for each individual or users
## Terms
- Authorization - access rules are for authenticated user and has access or is denied access. 
- Role Based Access Control - Users role in a application or organziation and permissions are granted to roles rather than to specific users or assets.
- Capabilities - different levels of access a user has.
