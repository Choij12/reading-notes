## Passing Functions as Props
- use `map()` function to take an array of numbers and double their values
- in react, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical
- users can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using `{}`
- before looping through the numbers array using `map()`, need to return a `<li>` for each item
- render it to the DOM after including listItems array inside a `<ul>` element
- render lists inside a component
- keys help react identify which items have changed, added, removed
- keys should be given to the element inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
- best way to pick a key is to use a string that identifies a list item among its siblings
- use id's from data as keys
- last resort to using item index as a key 
- do not recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change
- keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array
- element inside the `map()` call need keys
- keys must only be unique among siblings
- JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so it could inline the `map()` result

## The Spread Operator
- in JS spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots
- expand an iterable object into the list of arguments
- "when `...arr` is used in the function call, it 'expands' an iterable oject `arr` into the list of arguments." - JavaScript.info
- spread operator was added to JS in ES6 
- has the same syntax `...`
- spreads the array into separate arguments
- spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JS
- other things include - 1. copying an array 2. concatenating or combining arrays 3. using math functions 4. using an array as arguments 5. adding an item to a list
6. adding to a state in react 7. combining objects 8. converting NodeList to an array
- expands an iterable oject, usually an array including a string
- can convert `NodeList` and `arguments` onjects to arrays

## How to Pass Functions Between Components
- the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components is create a function and pass in a person object. modifying the array
- increment function - figures out the next node at the same level
- you pass a method by creating another function to run the event and passing the method into a child component to return
- the child component invokes by taking the code of child components of the first method and parent componenet of the second method
