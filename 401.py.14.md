## Matplotlib Tutorial
- `np.linspace([start], [stop], [quantity])` is used for producing numpy arrays of size quantity between the start and stop values. For example if you want to generate a bunch of x-coordinates to then calculate dependent y-coordinate out of, can use this to generate those x-coodinates.
- `plt.xlim([min], [max])` and `ylim` are used to set axis min and max limits.
- `plt.xticks([list of values to place ticks])` and `yticks` is used to set tick locations. 
- NullLocator (no ticks), IndexLocator (place ticks at multiples of base value).
- FixedLocator (use the specific ticks specified), LinearLocator (linearly spaced ticks).
- MultipleLocator, LogLocator (for log axis), and AutoLocator (auto placement).
- A figure (the window plots get drawn to) can have multiple subplots and multiple axes.
- A subplot is specified using `subplot([number of rows], [number of columns], [index of the subplot starting at 1])`. Axes can draw the axes anywhere in the figure: `axes([distance from left in proportional size to figure (0-1)], [distance from bottom], [horizontal size], [vertical size])`.
- Figures can be annotated using `plt.annotate([text to show, if latex used use "r'$latex stuff$', xy=[(x, y) location to point the annotation to], xycoords=['data' for using the (x, y) coordinates specified], xytext=[(offset x, offset y) for where to place the text], textcoords=['offset points' for using xytext with offsets], arrowprops=[dict(arrowstyle="->", connectionstyle="arc3, rad=0.2")`. 
- Lines can be drawn using `plt.plot([from this x value, to this x value],[from this y value, to this y value])`. To make the line vertical, just make the from/to x-values the same at the horizontal axis location to place the vertical line.
- `FuncAnimation([figure], [animation function], other parameters to look up just in time)`. Call `plt.show()` afterwards, unless in Jupyter notebook then `import IPython.display import HTML` and use `HTML([func animation object].to_html5_video())`.
- `[scatterplot_object].set_stuff()` to actually trigger the plot to register the changes.
- Use cartopy (`import cartopy`) for plotting maps. Place it on its own axis: `ax = plt.axes(projection=cartopy.crs.Miller())` is what the tutorial uses as an example. There's interesting features, so just be aware that cartopy exists for plotting map data, and use the reference.
- `np.meshgrid()` maybe useful to be aware of for contour plots and 3d surfaces. Cursory glance at trying to figure out what meshgrid produces is not entirely intuitive, but my best guess is for each item in the 1-d array it produces all the possible y values.
