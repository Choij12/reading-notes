# List Comprehensions
- This article covers list comprehensions, a way to make lists using the form: list = `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.
- Rather than using the expression in a for loop to fill an empty list to built a list. 
- List comprehension is the preferred way to make a list. 
- The expression is some action on item. 
- The iterable can be a generator, list, tuple, etc. To make a list of 0 through 5 incremented by 1, can do `[item for item in range(5)]`. 
- To make a list of 0 through 25, incremented by 5, can do `[item * 5 for item in range(5)]`. 
- To use an optional condition, such as a list of even number in range 10, can do: `[item for item in range(10) if item % 2 == 0]`. 
- The iterable can be a collection of strings too, and the expression can consist of string operations. 
- The collection can be of anything. There's really any no restrictions on what can be done, just remember the syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.
