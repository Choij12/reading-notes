## Python Regular Expressions Tutorial
Import re to use regular expressions. Methods:
- `compile`: Instead of using a regular expression string, can compile the string into a regular expression object for speed.
- `search`: Returns none if regex string isn't found anywhere in the string to search otherwise return match object that contains the location of the match.
- `match`: like search but only for the beginning of string.
- `search.group` / `match.group` - regular expression strings can be surrounded by parenthesis indicating a group; one string can have multiple search groups, and group(1) returns matches for the first group, group(2) returns matches for the second group, match(0) returns matches for all groups. Can use `(?<name>...)` to instead reference name (`match.group('name')`) instead of a group number.
- `findall`: returns all matches.
- `sub`: substitute matches with a different string.
- `subn`: same as above but instead of returning the modified string, returns a tuble of two with one value containing the modified string and the other value containing the number of replacements made.
- `split`: splits the string.
- `\t` - Lowercase t. Matches tab.
- `\n`- Lowercase n. Matches newline.
- `\r` - Lowercase r. Matches return.
- `\A` - Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.
- `\Z` - Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.
- `\b` - Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.
- `+` -	Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times.
- `*` -	Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times.
- `?`	- Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time.
- `{ }` -	Checks for an explicit number of times.
- `()` -	Creates a group when performing matches.
- `< >` -	Creates a named group when performing matches.

## shutil
Use `shutil` for file operations:
- `shutil.copyfileobj`: probably not going to remember the difference between the different copies, so look it up each time.
- `.copy`: behaves like terminal's `cp`.
- `.copymode`: can copy permissions on a file.
- `.copystat`: copies metadata.
- `.copytree`: copiesf rom one path to another
- `.which`: look in the path for a particular file name.
- `.get_archive_formats` / `.make_archive` / `.unpack_archive`: for dealing with tar, zip, etc files.
- `.disk_usage`: shows disk usage.
