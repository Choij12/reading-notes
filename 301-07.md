## How I explained REST to my brother
Who is Roy Fielding?
- Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers. He sent documents across the internet along with research explanining how the web server worked. His name is also on the specification for the protocl that is used to retrieve pages from servers to the browsers.
Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- It was not designed to be used like that, the techniques developers later used did not have the same requirements. 
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- The HTTP protocal that fielding and his friends created were about applying verbs to nouns. 
What does a GET do?
- GET is when the browsers get stuff. HTTP is just for GET'ing things.
What does a POST do?
- POST is when it adds something to another system or machine.
What does PUT do?
- PUT is when replaces something in another system or machine. 
What does PATCH do?
- PATCH is when it pushes partial updates to a system or in a machine. 

## API Keys
Yes, I got all the API Keys

## Things I want to know more of
- If one loses their keys, how fast are they able to recover it and if recovered, is it new or the same one as before?
