# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- React app is on one html page and renders components as needed as each page is a rerender of the DOM.
2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route /> - this is mount and render the components
3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
- The components get unmounted once a new route is requested.
4. What does props.children contain?
- props.children contains whatever the user inserts between the opening and closing tag. 
5. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
- useState() - functional components
- this.setState() - class components

## Terms

- State Hook -  allows the user to have state variables in functional components.
- Mounting and Un-Mounting - Mounting (or DOM creation, or "setup") phase. Unmounting (or deletion, or "cleanup") phase.
