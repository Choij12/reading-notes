# State and Props
## React lifecycle 
- react lets you define componenets as classes or functions
- lifecycle events
- lifecycle of a component, allows you to update the UI and application states
- mounting - updating - unmounting - three phases of the component lifecycle
- mounting - created and inserted into the DOM - constructor, static, getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount
- updating - component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered - static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps
- unmounting - final phase of the lifecycle - being removed from the DOM - componentWillUnmount
- counstructor() - react component is called before its mounted - ex codes -
`class FishTableRow extends React.Component {
constructor() {
super(props); //gives us access to props
//Donâ€™t call this.setState() here
this.state = { //intitialize local state
showDescription: false
}; }`
- avoid using `this.setState()` in the constructor since it can lead to side effects
- static getDerivedStateFromProps() - method for rare cases where the state relies on changes in props 
- render() - only required in a class component 
- compnenetDidMount() - invoked after a component is mounted - good place to set up any subscriptions - need to unsubscribe in componenetWillUnmount()
- setState() - used sparingly - cause a rerender 
- componentDidMount() - connect to the youtube API and get videos and components is rendered
- unsafe lifecycle events - UNSAFE_componentWillMount(), UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()

## React state vs Props
- props - arguments to a function 
- pass into props
- state is inside a component and handled inside
- props are outside the component and needs to be updated outside the component
- props can't change sinc
- props are able to rerender 
- when you change the state inside of the application, its going to rerender that section
- passed down as props
- state is there for when you need to rerender based on what the user inputs
- props are useful for when to display hardcoded code
- state is useful in a form
