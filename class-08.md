# CSS Layouts
- to contain and group together sections use `<div>`
- normal flow is standard unless users specify relative, absolute, or fixed
- to move contents left & right, use float property
- float also allows users to create multi-column
- floated items require the users to define width
- fixed width or liquid layouts
- typical size - 960-1000 pixels wide
- top 600 pixels are the content about what the page is about
- professional and flexible designs are the help with grids
- CSS frameworks provide rules to the user for tasks
- users are able to include multiple CSS files in a single page
