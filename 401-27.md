# Asynchronous Actions

1. How granular should your reducers be?
- It should only depend on the state they are modifying and the actions arguments needed to do so.
2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched?
- It is a Pro more than a Con since we have to change multiple states in multiple components, the fact that all the reducers can listen when the action is dispatched can reduce a lot of work
3. Name a strategy for preventing the above
- By Making a reducer for each component that will be affected by the dispatcher, it will only effect a specific amount of the state it self.

## Terms
- store - A store holds the whole state tree of your application.
- combined reducers - a helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function.
