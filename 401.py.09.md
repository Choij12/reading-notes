## Dunder Methods
- Dunder Methods are special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. 
-  `__init__` | Called when objects are initialized.
- `__str__` | str() and print(). Usually user focused string representation.
- `__repr__` | repr(). Usually programmer focused string representation.
- `__len__` | len(). Length.
- `__getitem__` | [ ]. Gets item at index, used for bracket notation.
- `__reversed__` | reversed(). Reverses order. The method might internally depend on getitem to work.
- `__eq__` | =. Used for equal to operator.
- `__lt__` | <. Used for less than operator.
- `__gt__` | >. Used for greather than operator.
-  `__add__` | +. Used for addition operator. Note that A + B may be different than B + A.
-  `__radd__` | +. Used for the right side add. Falls back to add if not implemented.
-  `__call__` | object(). When object is called as if it were a function.
-  `__enter__` | Needed for with statement. With statement will start with running enter.
-  `__exit__` | Needed for with statement. With statement will exit with this method. Useful for handling exceptions before exiting.

## Statistics - Probability
- Probability: The calculated chance of an event happening.
- Event: Outcome of interest
- `coin_trial` function is what represents a simulation of 10 coin tosses.
-  `random()` function to generate a float between 0 and 1, and increments our heads count if it’s within half of that range. 
-  `simulate` repeats these trials depending on how many times you’d like, returning the average number of heads across all of the trials.
- This article begins with descriptive statistics before moving on to probability.
It devises a method to demonstrate quantitatively if two groups are drawn from the same distribution using probability.
They evaluated two wine recommendations in this scenario and discovered that they are unlikely to come from the same score distribution. 
Than put it another way, one wine kind is almost certainly superior to the other. 
Statistics does not have to be restricted to statisticians alone. As a data scientist, having a basic awareness of what typical statistical measurements reflect will offer one an advantage when it comes to generating their own hypotheses and testing them.

- This video covers Statistical features, probability distributions, and Bayesian statistics and explained using code, theory, and animations.
