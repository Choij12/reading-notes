# SQL Practice
### Reginal Database: 
A relational database is a database organized according to the relational model of data. In simple terms, the relational model defines a set of relations (which we can think of as analogous to tables) and describes the relationships, or connections, between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact. 
Using the relational model elevates our database from data that is represented in just a flat, two-dimensional table, to one where we can describe the data in a more complex and detailed way. Using a relational database helps us to cut down on duplicated data and provides a much more useful data structure for us to interact with.

A relational database management system, or RDBMS, is essentially a software application, or system, for managing relational databases. 
An RDBMS allows a user, or another application, to interact with a database by issuing commands using syntax that conforms to a certain set of conventions or standards.

There are many relational database management systems such as SQLite, MS SQL, PostgreSQL and MySQL. Some are lightweight, easy to install and use, while others are robust, scalable, but are complex to install. These various RDBMSes may vary in certain ways, and some of the commands they use may have slight syntactical differences. One thing they have in common however is the underlying language they all use: SQL.
It is worth noting that the relational model is not the only structured data model used by database software. A program like MongoDB, for example, uses a document-oriented data storage model. This, and other systems using non-relational data storage and retrieval models, are often loosely grouped together under the term 'NoSQL'. For the purposes of this book however, we are only interested in the relational model and how SQL can be used to interact with relational databases.

### SQL:
Structured Query Language, is the programming language used to communicate with a relational database.
SQL is a powerful language that uses simple English sentences that, with a few lines, allow you to Select (find), Insert (add), Update (change), and Delete (remove) a large amount of data.
Relational databases have become so widespread that you're likely using multiple databases per day without even knowing it. Smaller examples include Firefox, which uses SQLite to keep track of the user's history and data, to banking systems which might be using an Oracle database to store daily transactions.
Creating a well-designed database is like laying the foundations of a house, and learning SQL and relational database concepts will help you build your applications on a strong foundation. Since databases are such a key part of almost all web applications, understanding the language of databases and how they work is a vital step towards becoming a well-rounded web-developer.
