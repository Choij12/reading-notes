## Forms
- HTML form elements work differently than other DOM elements in React
- form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` maintain their own state and update it based on user input
- mutable state is typicaly skept in the state property or component and only updated with `setState()`
- combine the two by making the react state be the single source
- renders a form and controls 
- Controlled component is a input form element that value is controlled by react 
- `value` attribute is set on our form element
- displayed value will always be `this.state.value` making the react state the source of truth
- `handleChange` runs on every keystroke to update the React state
- displayed value will update as the user types
- a `<textarea>` uses a value attribute instead
- form using `<textarea>` can be written very similarly to a form
- `<select>` creates a drop down list
- using a `value` attribute on the root select tag instead of selected
- more convenient in a controlled componenet since it only needs to update it in one place
- `<input type="text">`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` all work very similarly
- `<input type="file">` lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by js
- cause the value is read-only, uncontrolled componenet in react
- specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input
- updates as users types
- target by using <textarea> and <event.target.name>
## Conditional Operator
- using `if` statement, allows us to specify that a block of code should be executed `if` a certain cond is met
- `condition` is what the user is testing
- results should be `true` or `false` 
- `?` separates our conditional from our true value
- `?` and `:` is what executes if the condition is true
- if a condition executes false, a colon is executed
- possible to run multiple operations within a ternary
- must separate the operations with comma
- In Ternary Statement:
((x===y) ? true:false);
