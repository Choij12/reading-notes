# Testing and Modules

## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
- Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- The cycle is made by three steps:
1. Write a unit test and make it fail
2. Write the feature and make the test pass
3. Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one
- Takes a lot of practice! 
## If name equals main
- Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:
- it sets a few special variables like `__name__`, and then
- it executes all of the code found in the file.
- If you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.
## Recursion
- Recursion is defined as the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. - geeksforgeeks.org
#### Direct & Indirect Recursion 
- A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function.
- In tail recursion, there is no other operation to perform after executing the recursive function itself; the function can directly return the result of the recursive call. In non-tail recursion, some operations need to be performed using the returned value of the recursive call.
- Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive like tree traversals. - geeksforgeeks.org
