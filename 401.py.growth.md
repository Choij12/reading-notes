### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.
My takeaway from this Ted Talk is when Angela Lee Duckworth states, "Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint."

### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.
My takeaway from this Ted Talk is when Alian de Botton states, "There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before. One of these, and it's paradoxical, because it's linked to something that's rather nice, is the hope we all have for our careers. Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan. We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything. We've done away with the caste system, we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please. And it's a beautiful idea. Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality; we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies. There is one really big problem with this, and that problem is envy. Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy, but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality."

### Assess your emotional intelligence. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.
Upon completeing the emotional intelligence, I scored well on the self awareness as well as the social awareness cateogroy and have areas of growth in relationship management. 
### Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.
- The areas I have grown in recently are empathy and curiousity through being self aware as well as having a growth mindet.
