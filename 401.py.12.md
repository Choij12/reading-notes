# Pandas 

## 10 minutes to panda
- Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index.
- Creating a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns.
- The describe method gives an info summary of the dataset.
- NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column. 
- A column can be sliced out by selecting it by the column name: `df["column_name"]`, by selecting with row number: `df[0:5]` for the first few rows, by selecting index names (can be a range: `df["first_date":"second_date"]`.
- Use the loc method to select based on a label (like the name of a row/column) and iloc to select based on the position (like the row/column number).
- Slicing using a criteria is possible: `df[df["col1"] > value]` to filter to the rows where col1 values are greater than the value, or isin to filter based on multiple categorical values. Setting values also works, so slicing works for both reading and setting: `df["a"] = something` or the use of at and iat methods.
- If data is missing it'll be a np.nan value which are typically excluded from math. 
- Can use dropna method to remove them and fillna to replace them.
- There's convenience methods for mean, sum, etc.  If the convenience methods are insufficient, there's the apply method to apply any function to all the columns, for example: `df.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())` is the example the link uses, where x is the entire column; the output is the differences for each column.
- Concatenating (low appending rows) dataframes is possible with the concat method.
- SQL-like merge of two dataframes is possible with the merge method, as is grouping using the groupby method.
- Data can be reshaped between short and long formats using the stack and unstack methods; similarly pivots can be done using pivot_table. 
- Plotting data is possible using matplotlib.pyplot. If multiple series are plotted on the same chart, first create a `plt.figure()`, then `df.plot()` to add to it, then add the `plt.legend()` to the figure, which is honestly a bit confusing to me how df.plot knows to use that specific figure.
- Use to_csv and read_csv to access csv file data; similarly to_hdf and read_hdf.
- The close() method is used to close a figure window.
