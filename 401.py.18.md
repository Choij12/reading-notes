# Cryptography
- A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. 
- Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. 
- Caesar cipher with a shift of 11 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.
- The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
- A Caesar cipher is very easy to design, but also very easy to decode.
- To crack a Caesar code, a decoder could simply go through every possible shift of the alphabet.
- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
