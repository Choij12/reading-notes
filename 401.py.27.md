# Django Models & Django Admin
 - In python, Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.
 - Users can just write the model structure and other code, and Django handles al of communicating with the database.
 - When designing models be sure to have separate models for every "object" (a group of related information).
 - Use models to represent selection-list options (e.g. like a drop down list of choices), rather than hard coding the choices into the website itself — this is recommended when all the options aren't known up front or may change.
 - Django allows relationships that are one to one `(OneToOneField)`, one to many `(ForeignKey)` and many to many `(ManyToManyField)`.
 - Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. 
 - They are subclasses of `django.db.models.Model`, and can include fields, methods and metadata.
 - Models can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables.
 - help_text: Provides a text label for HTML forms (e.g. in the admin site), as described above.
 - verbose_name: A human-readable name for the field used in field labels. If not specified, Django will infer the default verbose name from the field name.
 - default: The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object, in which case the object will be called every time a new record is created.
 - null: If True, Django will store blank values as NULL in the database for fields where this is appropriate (a CharField will instead store an empty string). The default is False.
 - blank: If True, the field is allowed to be blank in your forms. The default is False, which means that Django's form validation will force you to enter a value. This is often used with null=True , because if you're going to allow blank values, you also want the database to be able to represent them appropriately.
 - choices: A group of choices for this field. If this is provided, the default corresponding form widget will be a select box with these choices instead of the standard text field.
 - primary_key: If True, sets the current field as the primary key for the model (A primary key is a special database column designated to uniquely identify all the different table records). If no field is specified as the primary key then Django will automatically add a field for this purpose. The type of auto-created primary key fields can be specified for each app in AppConfig.default_auto_field or globally in the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting.
 - The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records.
 - makes it easy to my models and get a feel for whether you have the right data
 - The admin application can also be useful for managing data during production, depending on the type of website you've created
 - The Django project recommends using admin for internal data management for ex: just for use by admins, or people internal to your organization. The model-centric approach is not necessarily the best possible interface for all users and it exposes a lot of unecessary details about the models
