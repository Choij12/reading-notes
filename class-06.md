# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM
## Problem Domain
- hardest thing about writing code -
- 1. learning new tech
- 2. naming things
- 3. testing code
- 4. debugging
- 5. fixing bugs
- 6. sowftare maintenance 
- programming is easy once a user understands the domain
- make the domain easier
- understand the domain
### Objects
- Eight data types
- 1. Boolean
- 2. Null
- 3. Undefined
- 4. Number
- 5. BigInt
- 6. String
- 7. Symbol
- 8. Objects
- value vs reference - stores in JS programs in different ways
- Immutable vs Mutable - Immutable and objects references are mutable
- Primitive values and object reference affect variable assignments
- Primitve values and ogject references affect equality comparisons
- Primitive values are immutable and cannot be changed after being created
- Object references are mutable and can be changed
#### Object Literals & Document Object Model
- Object - groups a set of variables and functions to create a model
- variables and functions take on new names
- literal notation - easiest and most popular way to create objects
- dot notation allows one to access the properties or methods of an object
- DOM tree - browser represents the page
- four nodes within a DOM tree -
- 1. document nodes
- 2. element nodes 
- 3. attribute nodes
- 4. text nodes
- `id` or `class`, tag names, css selector to select element nodes
- if able to return more than one node, DOM query will return it as NodeList
- users will be able to acess and update contents using properties in the element node
- element node - multiple text nodes and child elements that are sibilings
- browers offers tools to view DOM tree
