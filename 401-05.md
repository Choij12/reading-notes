1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- "Singleton" is when a module exports a lone instance of itself as one instance of it is needed. 
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
- Singleton pattern can be used to allow instances of creating a class. By exporting a singleton object, only one instnace will be exported from the node module.
3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- The approach I would take is to build a system similar to Express. By using singlton to represent a server, I would take an approach by pushing any middleware functions into a collection within my server and have the req, res iterate through. 
## Terms
Router Middleware - middleware that manages incoming HTTP reqs
Dynamic Module Loading - this allows the computer to upload, retrieve, and execute functions all within from the library. 
Singleton Pattern - this ensures there's only a single instance of an object
CRUD -> REST Method Matches - POST -> Create, GET -> Read, PUT -> Update/Replace, PATCH -> Update/Modify, DELETE -> Delete
Mock Testing - allows the user to quickly test and in a more reliable way.
