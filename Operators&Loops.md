# Operators
- JavaScript has the following types of operators
- 1. assignemnt
- 2. comparison
- 3. arithmetic
- 4. bitwise
- 5. logical
- 6. string
- 7. conditional 
- 8. comma
- 9. unary
- 10. relational
- javascript contains both binary and unary operators, one special ternary operator, the conditonal operator
- binary operator requires two operands, 1 before and after

# Loops and iteration
- computerized version of the game where one tells another to take x number of steps in one direction then y steps in another
- many types of loops but all essentially the same thing
- various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points
- various of situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others
- statement of loops include: 
- 1. for statement
- 2. do... while statement
- 3. while statement
- 4. labeled statement
- 5. break statement
- 6. continue statement
- 7. for... in statement
- 8. for... of statement

## For 
- `for` loop repats til specified condition evaluates to `false`
- in javascript, `for` loop is similar to the java and c `for` loop
- The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed - it usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity
- this expression can also declare variables
- the conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute
- if the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates
- if present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed
- Control returns to step 2

### While
- executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`
- if `condtion` becomes `false` the `statement` within stops executing and control passes to next statement
- condtion test occurs before and if the condition returns `true` the statement will be executed and the condtion will be tested again
- if false, execution stops and control is passed to the next statement
- use block statement to execute multiple statements `{...}`
