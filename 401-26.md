# Redux - Combined Reducers

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
- When and if the user has a lot of dynamic data, Redux is more useful. 
2. What is the purpose of a reducer?
- The purpose of a reducer is for to manage state in an application.
3. What does an action contain?
- An Action contains a type and payload, that tells our reducer what to do and provides it the data it needs to do that action.
4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
- We need to copy the state in a reducer since if the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged parts.

## Terms
- immutable state - an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created
- time travel in redux - keeping track of all slices in your state and moving them forward or backward with time travel events.
- action creator - a function that literally creates an action object. 
- reducer - pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state.
- dispatch - function of the Redux store.
