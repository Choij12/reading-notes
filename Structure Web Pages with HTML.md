- method often used by UX designers

- focuses on how the user wants the consumer to process the information on a site
- great way of feedback from how consumers interacts with users interface

## Examples of Wireframe
- Invision & Balsamiq
- can be drawn by hand

### Things to consider before wireframing
- Different ways designers can structure the process: 
- 1. Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- 2. Sketch > Code
- 3. Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- 4. Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
- 
### Best tools for wireframing
- lots of free resources on the web
- paper and pencil - 
- UXPin
- InVision
- Wireframe.cc

#### Steps to make a wireframe
- 1. research
- 2. prepare research for a quick reference
- 3. user flow is mapped out
- 4. draft & sketch
- 5. add details and test
- 6. begin turning wireframes into prototypes

##### Three principles that are key to a good wireframe
- clarity: answer the question of what the site is
- confidence: easy navigation
- simplicity: stay away from things that can be distracting to the user

# HTML
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of one's content
- consits of series of elements

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - doctype
- `<html><html>` - element
- `<head><head>` - head element
- `<title><title>` - title element
- `<body><body>` - body element
- `<img src"link">` image

- there is semantics in Javascript, CSS, HTML
- benefits from writing semantics:
- 1. search engines will consider its content as important 
- 2. can help visually impared users navigate a page
- 3. easier to find blocks of meaningful code
- 4. suggests that the type of data will be populated
- 5. mirrors proper custom elememt
