1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
- 1. A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
- 2. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
- 3. The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.

- 5. The view renders the page as HTML.
- 6. The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it
