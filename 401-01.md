1. Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
- `Array.map()` is a method that calls the passed in callback function for each element. It is also used as the argument to the callback. The returned value from each call returns both a new and the original array. 
2. Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
- `Array.reduce()` is a method when used on an array calls the passed in callback function for each element. The array should result in a single value. 
3. Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result
 
 With normal Promise .then() syntax
 - `super.get(API)
  .then(res => console.log(data.body.lat, data.body.long))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));`
  
Again with async / await syntax 
- `try {
  const data = await superagent.get(API);
  console.log(data.body.lat, data.body.long);
} catch(err) {
  console.log(err);`
  
4. Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
- Promises are objects that represents the eventual completion or a failure of an asynchronous operation and its end result value. Promises have three states, which are pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
5. Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
- All callback functions are not considered to be Asynchronous but by using them in combination with asynchronous codes it can be asynchronous.
