# FileIO & Exceptions

## Reading and Writing Files in Python
- Files are contiguous set of bytes used to store data. 
- Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
- 1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- 2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- 3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
- Three major parts of file paths are: 
- 1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- 2. File Name: the actual name of the file
- 3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
- Open() -The open() function is used to open files in our system, the filename is the name of the file to be opened. 
- Read () - The read functions contains different methods, read(),readline() and readlines().
- Write () - This method writes a sequence of strings to the file.
- Append () - The append function is used to append to the file instead of overwriting it. To append to an existing file, simply open the file in append mode (“a”):
- Close() - When you’re done with a file, use close() to close it and free up any system resources taken up by the open file

## Python Exceptions
- Syntax errors happens when the parser detects an incorrect statement.
- Users can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.
- A try clause is executed up until the point where the first exception is encountered.
- Inside the except clause, or the exception handler, you determine how the program responds to the exception.
- You can anticipate multiple exceptions and differentiate how the program should respond to them.
- Avoid using bare except clauses.
- raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isn’t.
- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
- except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.

## Reading and Writing files in Python
- Basically it was a review of both aritles about what makes up a file and why that’s important in Python.
- The video also covers the basics of reading and writing files in Python
- The video has some basic scenarios of reading and writing files.
