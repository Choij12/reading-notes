### How to use Random Module
- The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. 
- When making a password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.
- Randint - accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
- Random - If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.
- Choice - Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
- Shuffle - The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
- Randrange - Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

### What is Risk Analysis
- Risk is defined as the probability of any unwanted incident.
- Risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas.
- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required
- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
- Three perspectives of Risk Assessment:
- 1. Effect
- 2. Cause
- 3. Likelihood

### Test Coverage
- Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test
- What Test Coverage does?
- 1. Finding the area of a requirement not implemented by a set of test cases
- 2. Helps to create additional test cases to increase coverage
- 3. Identifying a quantitative measure of test coverage, which is an indirect method for quality check
- 4. Identifying meaningless test cases that do not increase coverage
