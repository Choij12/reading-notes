# Data Modeling
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- 1. Only have to write what is needed to pass the test
- 2. Modular Code
- 3. Easier to maintain and refactor
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
1. `beforeEach()` - is used before tests
2. `afterEach()` - is used after tests
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- Its slow and not as flexible
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- ES6 classes - type of which can instaniated during a runtime and is a template
- Constructor/Prototype - Method at which is an object instance
5. Why REST?
- REST provides more flexibility and can handle multiple types of calls
## Terms 
- functional programming - programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
- object-oriented programming (OOP) - is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career.
- class - for creating objects
- super - used to access functions from the parent
- this - referring to an object 
- Test Driven Development (TDD) - process in which it converts test cases till its complete
- Jest - testing framework
- Continuous Integration (CI) - where dev merge their commits into a central repo
- REST - architercural stype for distruted hyermedia systems
- Data Model - process in which is used to store data and model relationships with the data
