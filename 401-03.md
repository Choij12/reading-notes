## Express REST API

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- User verification
- Classified information
- Authetication
2.True or false: The route handler is middleware?
- False 
3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
- by invoking the next() function and place any text into the parameters.
4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
- As soon as the request gets to the server
5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
- If there is two res sent to the client, with `response.send()` twice can also cause that issue.
