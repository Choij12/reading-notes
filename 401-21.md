# Context API

1. Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
- useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
2. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
- to have an extra option for sharing state and logic between components.
3. What do custom hooks usually do?
- Custom hooks usually helps with the reusablity for code as well as make the functional components clear.
4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications 
- One example would be `useAuth()` and it is to authenticate the user.
5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
- One example of a hook would be the `useEffect()` and it runs when the request for the API updates and calls the the API function in which is able to fetch data from.

## Terms
- Reducer - a function which takes two arguments â€” the current state and an action and returns based on both arguments a new state.
