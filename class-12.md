## Canvas API
- `<canvas>` doesn't have `src` and `alt` attributes
- can look like `<img>`
- only two attributes width and height
- optional and can be set using DOM properties 
- initally be 300px wide and 150px high
- can be styled with margin, border, background...

- easy to define some fallback content
- requires closing tags
- unlike `<SVG>` it only supports two primitive shapes
- `fillRect()` function draws large black square 
- `clearRect()` erases square from the circle
- `strokeRect()` is called to create a rectangular outline
- Path methods - set different paths for objects
- `closePath()` add a straight line to the path
- `stroke()` draws the shape by stroking its outline
- `fill()` draws the solid shape by filling the path's content
- `moveTo(x,y)` moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y
- fillstyle = color - sets the style used when filling shapes
- strokeStyle = color - sets the style for shapes outlines
- `globalAlpha = transparencyValue`
- using `rgba()` gives the user a little more control and flexibility 
- `lineWidth = value` - sets the width of lines drawn
- `lineCap = type` - sets the appearance of the ends of the lines
- `lineJoin = type` - sets the appearance of the corners where the lines meet
- `miterLimit = value` sets the limit on a miter 
- `getLineDash()` returns the current line dash pattern array of even of non negative numbers
- `setLineDash(segments)` sets the current line dash pattern
