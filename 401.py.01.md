## Pain vs. Suffering
I agree that pain is part of growth and the process of learning and becoming better. 
"All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life." - [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

## Beginners Guide to Big O
###### Summary:
- Big O is used to describe the order of the worst case execution time. The order is:
- O(1) - constant time, eg: get/push/pop an index in an array
- O(log N) - logarithmic time, eg. binary search
- O(N) - linear time, eg. a single for loop
- O(N^c) - polynomial time if c is greater than 1, eg. a nested for loop
- O(2^N) - exponential time, eg. fibonacci recursion where each additional number doubles the calls to itself. At least without memoization.
- O(N!) - factorial time, eg. going through all the permutations.
- There can be combinations of these, eg: O(N log N).
