## Thinking in React
-  1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? - The single responsibility principle is when a component should do one thing and if it ends up enlarging, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
-  2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? - A 'static' version of an application means a site without any user interativity. No state is used in a static application.
- 3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? - a set of mutuable state that an app needs.
- 4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? -
- 1. Is it passed from a parent through props? If yes, it's a state. 2. Is it static? If not, it's a state. 3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in a component? If yes, it is not a state.
- 5. How can you identify where state needs to live? - indentifying components that renders based on a certain state, finding common parents or another component higer in the hieracjy should be the owner of the state. 

## Higer Order Functions
- 1. What is a “higher-order function”? - A function that uses other functions as an argument. 
- 2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words. - a certain variable is set to return if a certain variable is greater than the next.
- 3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions - Map method is able to transform an array by applying functions to its elements and is then pushed into a new array based on the return values of those passed in the function. 

## Things I want to know more about: 
- live applications of this higher order function in a site.
