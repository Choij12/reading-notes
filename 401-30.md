## Ethics in the workplace 
- Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used for Weapons or Surveillance by Kate Konger.
- This article relates to ethics in technology by Google backtracking themselves and stating that they are committed to not using artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance. Although I am for advancement in technology but when it invloves weapons and surveilance, I am opposed to it as AI could be considered as part of the advancement. I understand the how Google could consider this prior to its employees protesting but this would've made sense for them as goverment contracts are worth millions to billions and Google could have profited a lot from it but I agree that they made the right decision. 
One thing in this article that stuck out to me was that Google was part of the Maven contract with the goverment and they plan to gaining more contracts without the use of AI but as in business around the use of AI. 

## Ethics in Technology
- The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars by Jason Kornwitz.
- This article relates to ethics in technology by the question of how vulnerable of self driving cars and how particularly susceptible to hackers.
It states that any computerized system that has an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable. And that any computer engineers/developers knows that it is very difficult to create software without any bugs, therefore, bugs can sometimes be a secuirty threat.
I agree in the fact that according to the article, it states that the goverment should be invloved and help secure these technology but at the same time, goverments are known to profit from their involvement..
One thing that stuck out to me in this artile is that how vunerable these self driving cars that are meant to help drivers can also be used as a weapon.
