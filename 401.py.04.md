## Classes and Objects
- Objects are defined as an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. 
- Classes give the objects their variables and functions. 
- Classes are also known as a template to create objects.
- Userscan create multiple different objects that are of the same class. 
- However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class.
- The `__init__()` function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for asigning values in a class.

## Thinking Recursively
- Recursion is considered one of the advanced techniques that a programmer needs to go through along their journey to becoming a programmer that are good at what they do.
- Solve the problem using loops first.
- From that, extract the possible inputs if you would turn this into a function.
- Deduct the simplest version of the problem.
- Write a function that solves the simplest instance of that problem.
- Use that function to write a new recursive function.

## Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage
- In pytest, one defines fixture as using a combination of the `pytest.fixture` decorator, along with a function definition.
- One also can decide how often a fixture is run.
- Some fixtures work quite differently from the traditional setup/teardown system that many other test systems use.
