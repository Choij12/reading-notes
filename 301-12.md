## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick
1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
- Since it is what the user needs to access mongoDB but since its private, it will be kept separate. 
2. What is middleware?
- its a function that one combines multiple similar functions with the same request.
3. What does app.use(express.json()) do?
- It allows the server to accept JSON as the body inside of a GET/Post request
4. What does the /:id mean in a route?
- its a parameter on a request
5. What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?
- PUT - updates an item PATCH - updates only specific piece of information that's passed
6. How do you make a defalut value in a schema?
- by using default as the key and default value with the value.
7. What does a 500 error status code mean?
- error on the server, could be a bug in the code.
8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
