# Permissions & Postgresql
## DRF Permissions

- Permissions are authentication or identification by itself is not usually sufficient to gain access to information or code. For that, the entity requesting access must have authorization.
- Permissions are determined by: - Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.
- If any permissions checks fail, you will likely get the following exceptions:
- `exceptions.PermissionDenied` or `exceptions.NotAuthenticated`
- When the permission checks fail, you either get a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response. This is according to the following rules:
- The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` header will be returned.
- Object level permissions:
- "Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance."
- REST frameworks permissions fact: It supports object-level permissioning
- Important Note: "Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called."
```
def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

- Setting the permission policy **globally**
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
- Setting the permission policy, **allowing unrestricted access:**
```
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```
- You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views
- `AllowAny` permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.
- `IsAuthenticated` permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.
- `IsAdminUser` permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.
-`IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` will allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`.
