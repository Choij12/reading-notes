## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
1. What is a ‘call’?
- A call is the invocation of a function.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
- Function execution is done one at a time.
3. What does LIFO mean?
- LIFO means last in, first out, this is a data structure where the last function that is pushed into the stack is the first one to be returned.
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
- `function1(){console.log('hi')}`
- `function2(){function1()}`
- `function3(){function2()}`
- once you call `function3()` an empty stack is created and `function2()` is pushed into the stack then `function2()` is then pushed into the stack and console.logs "hi" in which calls `function1()` then 2 then 3 clearing the storage.
5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
- Stack Overflow is caused by when there are recurisve functions without an exit point.
