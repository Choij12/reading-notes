## Express
1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- PUT - Method of mdifying resource where the clinet sends data that updates the entire object
- PATCH - Unlike PUT- applies only partial update of the object that sends data
2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
- ![Nock](https://nordicapis.com/10-tools-to-mock-http-requests/#:~:text=1%20%E2%80%93-,Nock,-Nock%20is%20an)
- ![MockServer](https://nordicapis.com/10-tools-to-mock-http-requests/#:~:text=2%20%E2%80%93-,MockServer,-MockServer%20(and%20its)
- ![Beeceptor](https://nordicapis.com/10-tools-to-mock-http-requests/#:~:text=3%20%E2%80%93-,Beeceptor,-Beeceptor%20is%20a)
3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- Swagger & APIDoc.js - both require documentation content on implemnted methods but swagger uses plain.js unlike APIDoc.js.
-  Informational responses (100–199)
- Successful responses (200–299)
- Redirection messages (300–399)
- Client error responses (400–499)
- Server error responses (500–599)
4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
- SOAP - XML format - protocal and a simple object access 
- Rest - XML format - but also works with HTML, JSON - state transfer and has a architectural pattern
### Terms
- Web Server - software & hardware that uses HTTP to display content
- Express - open source web application framework for node.js used to design, build web application
- Routing - end point of an server once after a specific action
- WRRC - Web Request Response Cycle - process when requesting server for data
### Preview 
1. Express, SOAP ReST
2. PUT, PATCH, APIDocs.js
3. Anything and everything.
