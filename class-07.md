# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
## Domain Modeling
- process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem
- describes the various entities
- object oriented model
- define a constructor and initialize properties 
- `new` keyword instantiates an object
- constructor function initalizes properties inside that object using the `this` variable
- object is stored ina variable for later use
### Tables
- `<table>` element is used to add tables to a page
- `<tr>` useed to create rows
- each row, number of cells represented by `<td>` or `<th>` - for headers
- rowspan and colspan make cells 
- `<thead>` `<tbody>` `<tfood>` used to split the table
#### Functions, Methods, and Objects
- functions allow a user to group a set of related statements together to do a single task
- functions can take parameeters and return a value
- object is a series of varaibles and functions
- variables are known as properties of the object
- functions are known as methods of the object
- browsers implement objects 
- JS - built in objects 
- 1. String
- 2. Number
- 3. Math
- 4. Date
- helps write scripts 
- objects and arrays create complex data sets
